# Boshi's Gecko Codes
This will contain every gecko code I have made for Wii Games, except for the corruptions codes shown on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BowserJrGamer1). If you want to use the gecko codes in your own videos, then you are welcome to as long as you credit me and any other people that helped with the gecko code you used.

## Instructions

1. Choose a game and select a gecko code
2. Select your region and version. Copy the Gecko Code (If there is an X follow the instructions on the page) (Steps 3-6 is for dolphin) (Steps 7-11 is for console)
3. Right-Click on the Game you chose, and go to "Properties" (make sure "Enable Cheats" is on already)
4. Go to Gecko Codes and click "Add New Code"
5. Name it the code's name and paste the gecko code.
6. Save it (make sure it's turned on), and launch the game
7. Download the Game ID for the gecko codes (e.g RSPE01 = Wii Sports NTSC) (Search "replace this with your game" game id on google to find it)
8. Save the code onto your code loader on your SD Card (I would recommend using USB Loader GX or Wii Flow to play the codes separately)
9. Launch your Wii/vWii and go to your USB Loader on either the Homebrew Channel or the forwarder.
10. Select your game, then go to settings and select on Cheats
11. Select the Gecko Codes you want and save then launch the game.

## Credits

All of the gecko codes provided were made by me and are shown on the combined code. If someone else helped to fix the code they will also be mentioned.
