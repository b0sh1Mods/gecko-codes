## Custom Island Mode

Makes it so Wuhu Island is either Day, Evening, or Night. Kiwi and JimmyKaz already discovered this, but I just wanted to share, because I don't like gatekeeping or other people gatekeeping
Change the X to one of these Values: 0 = Day (Default), 1 = Evening, and 2 = Night
This affects every part of the game, besides the Golf Modes
