## Tragic Table Tennis 

Makes it so Table Tennis is the hardest sport in WSR. It's not done yet, but I still wanted to share the progress.

## Disclaimer

This code is NOT done yet, so far I have the code provided just makes it so you have to get an 13-0 but if you miss a point you lose the game, and it disables going to the home menu.

## WARNING (IMPORTANT)

The disable going to the home menu applies to everything in WSR. I will say it again "EVERYTHING". The only way to go back to the Wii Menu is turning off your console.

Give me more ideas to make this harder in the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the page.
