## Tragic Table Tennis 

Makes it so Table Tennis is the hardest sport in WSR. The code makes it so you have to get an 13-0 but if you miss a point you lose the game, disables going to the home menu, disables pausing, and it makes it so 1 in every 4 games is Lucia.

## WARNING (IMPORTANT)

The disable going to the home menu applies to everything in WSR. I will say it again "EVERYTHING". The only way to go back to the Wii Menu is turning off your console. It's the same with normal pausing. I would recommend pressing 2 on your Wii Remote before the game, so it loads the 11 point match. If your Wii Remote disconnects or loses batteries, TURN OFF THE CONSOLE, otherwise the game will crash because it doesn't have the pause menu to trigger it.

Give me more ideas to make this harder in the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the page.
