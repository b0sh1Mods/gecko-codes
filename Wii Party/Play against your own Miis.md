## Play against your own Miis

The actual gecko code is on [this website](https://b0sh1Mods.github.io/GeckoCodes.html), but I don't think anyone will understand how to get it working right

## Instructions:

1. Go into House Party and select either the bomb games. or the seeking game (forgot what it's called)
2. Select 4 Players, and choose the Miis you want to play against "Player 1 doesn't matter tho" (This is important as if not done, it will display regular CPU Miis)
3. Go back into any game (that works) and select 1 player, click start and you should see the miis you picked appear as CPU Miis (Names transferred as well)

## Progress

### Party Games:
Board Game Island: Loads but crashes as soon as fade in end (when the first minigame starts)

Globe Trot: Works perfectly

Swap Meet: Works perfectly

Spin Off: Doesn't work at all

Bingo: Works pefectly


### Pair Games:
Balance Boat: Loads but crashes after completing the first minigame

Match up: Doesn't work at all


### Minigame Modes:
Battle: Doesn't work


### 4 Player Minigames (only ones that don't work cuz it too long):
Goal Getters: Loads but crashes as soon as a CPU kicks the ball

Maze Daze: Loads but crashes as soon as a CPU Mii goes on the spinning thing

Friendly Face-Off: Works but can only select one piece

Strategy Steps: Works but softlocks after selecting all numbers

Hammer Heads: Works but crashes after you finish it

Rope Sling: Same thing as Hammer Heads I think (Idk if it's dolphin)
