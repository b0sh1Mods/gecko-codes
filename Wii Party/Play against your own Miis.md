## Play against your own Miis

The actual gecko code is on [this website](https://b0sh1Mods.github.io/GeckoCodes.html), but I don't think anyone will understand how to get it working right

## Instructions:

1. Go into House Party and select either the bomb games. or the seeking game (forgot what it's called)
2. Select 4 Players, and choose the Miis you want to play against "Player 1 doesn't matter tho" (This is important as if not done, it will display regular CPU Miis)
3. Go back into any game (that works) and select 1 player, click start and you should see the miis you picked appear as CPU Miis (Names transferred as well)

## Progress

# Main Game:
Board Game Island: Loads but crashes as soon as fade in end (when the first minigame starts)
Globe Trot: Works perfectly
Swap Meet: Works perfectly
Spin Off: Doesn't work at all
Bingo: Works pefectly
