## No Putt Challenge

This will allow the training game putting to be able to use any tool, even the driver

There is another code to make it so the little golf balls at the corner is always set to 5

As it says on the top, NO PUTTER, only wedge, iron, and driver (if I can do it with a real wii remote you can too)

If you're too good at this challenge and think it's too easy, remove lines 3-4 for hard mode ;)

I would recommend using a real wiiremote if you are on dolphin
