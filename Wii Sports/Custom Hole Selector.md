## Custom Hole Selector

This code makes it so you can choose what Golf Hole you can play and it stays like that

I would recommend using a wind mod like "Zero Wind", because the code makes it so the Wind is always 32 MPH/16 m/s south or more.

Replace X with 0-8 for normal holes and 9-A for unused holes on console and B-C for unused holes on Dolphin

If you load the B-C unused holes on console, the game will crash

RESET IF YOU COMPLETED A HOLE. If you don't the game will crash. You can either go to the home menu to reset or use the [Pause Anytime] (https://www.speedrun.com/wiisports/resources/04hpj) code to restart the game.
