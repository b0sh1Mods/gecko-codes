## Custom Hole Selector

This code makes it so you can choose what Golf Hole you can play and it stays like that

I would recommend using a wind mod like "Zero Wind", because the code makes it so the Wind is always 32 MPH/16 m/s south or more.

Replace X with 0-8 for normal holes and 9-A for unused holes on console and B-C for unused holes on Dolphin

If you load the B-C unused holes on console, the game will crash

This code does NOT work at all. If someone can fix it, I would love it.
